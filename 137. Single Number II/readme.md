# 137. Single Number II

<pre>Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.</pre>

 

### Example 1:
<pre>
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3</pre>

### Example 2:
<pre>
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99</pre>
 

### Constraints:
<pre>
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.</pre>
