# 530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST

<pre>Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.</pre>

 

### Example 1:


<pre>Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1</pre>

### Example 2:

<pre>
Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1
 </pre>

<pre>Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 104].
0 <= Node.val <= 105
