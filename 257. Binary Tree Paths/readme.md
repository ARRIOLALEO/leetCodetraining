# 257. Binary Tree Paths

<pre>Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A leaf is a node with no children.</pre>

 

### Example 1:

<pre>
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]
</pre>
### Example 2:
<pre>
Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]
 </pre>

### Constraints:
<pre>
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100</pre>
