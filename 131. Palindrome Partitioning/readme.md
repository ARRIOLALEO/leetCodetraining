# 131. Palindrome Partitioning

Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

 

### Example 1:

<pre>Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]</pre>

### Example 2:

<pre>Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]</pre>
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 16
s contains only lowercase English letters.
