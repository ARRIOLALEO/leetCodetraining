# 389. Find the Difference

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

### Example 1:

<pre>Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.</pre>

### Example 2:

<pre>Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"</pre>

### Example 3:

<pre>Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: "a"</pre>
### Example 4:

<pre>Input: s = "ae", t = "aea"
Output: "a"</pre>
 

### Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lower-case English letters.
